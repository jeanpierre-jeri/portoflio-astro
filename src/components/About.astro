    The long barrow was built on land previously inhabited in the Mesolithic
    period. It consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus, estimated to have
    been 15 metres (50 feet) in length, with a chamber built from sarsen
    megaliths on its eastern end. Both inhumed and cremated human remains were
    placed within this chamber during the Neolithic period, representing at
    least nine or ten individuals.
